### 1-star
- Randomly generate 10 ghosts on the canvas.
- Each ghost moves at a constant speed with a random velocity between -5 ~ 5 (MAX_SPEED)
- Use Arrays to manage the ghosts (x, y, xSpeed, ySpeed) in a game, and use a loop to draw all the ghosts onto the canvas.
### 2-star
- Design a ghostAlive[] boolean array to manage the ghosts that are still alive. 
- When a ghost is killed, it should be removed from the screen (not displayed).
### 3-star
- Display explosion effect at the position of the ghost that has been hit.
- The explosion effect will disappear after all five frames of the flame animation have finished displaying.
- Use Arrays to manage the explosion effects.
